- **Backup Friendly**: Same file structure makes migration easy
- **Multi-User Potential**: Architecture supports multiple users (with modifications)

## Security Features Maintained

1. **Master Password Protection**: SHA-256 hashing maintained
2. **AES Encryption**: Identical encryption implementation for stored passwords
3. **OTP Verification**: Email-based verification for sensitive operations
4. **Password Strength Requirements**: Enhanced real-time validation
5. **Session Security**: Proper authentication flow for viewing accounts
6. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information leakage

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended for Testing)
- Run Flask server locally (localhost:5000)
- Access web interface through browser
- Perfect for testing and development

### Option 2: Network Deployment
- Deploy Flask server on local network
- Access from multiple devices
- Suitable for home/office network use

### Option 3: Cloud Deployment (Advanced)
- Deploy to cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean)
- Add HTTPS and production security measures
- Global accessibility

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (5 minutes)
1. Download all created files
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run server: `python server.py`
4. Open web application: [Web Interface](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/ef1a4331af01d891f0765e72fbff4d0d/d7539cf7-5a00-497a-aaf7-832daacb19db/index.html)
5. Set up master password and start using!

### Development Setup
1. Use the provided startup scripts (`start_server.sh` or `start_server.bat`)
2. Configure email settings in `config.env` for OTP functionality
3. Monitor console for debug information and OTPs

## Migration from Original Application

Your existing data files (`master_password.txt` and `passwords.txt`) are **100% compatible** with the new web version. Simply:

1. Copy your existing files to the backend directory
2. Start the new web server
3. All your accounts and master password will work immediately
